#summary CPU implementation of md5

= md5.c =

I've added the cpu md5 implementation. I used the standard RSA code and modified it.

Amongst these modifications is a test function. I read in the Ubuntu dictionary file (which has about 100,000 words) and then hash them all.
{{{
stefano@stefano-pc:~/cudamd5$ time ./md5 -t
98568 words digested.

real    0m0.185s
user    0m0.184s
sys     0m0.000s
}}}

This is a substantial improvement on our original perl+md5sum app which took ~6mins to achieve the same task.
